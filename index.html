         <p>Many aspects of our world, from the body mass of creatures in the animal kingdom to the population of cities across the globe, follow an intriguing mathematical pattern. 
            Known as Zipf's law, the rule says that when something's size is doubled, that thing becomes about half as common. 
            Researchers wondered whether the law extended to the human body. 
            Ecologist Ian A. Hatton of McGill University, independent researcher Jeffery A. 
            Shander and their colleagues amassed data about the volume and frequency of human cells and looked for the pattern.
            It turns out that it holds.</p>

        <p>Human body is very complicated kind of mystery or maze where you try to resolve issues but you can't resolve enough.
           So, you get lost in finding solutions of problems in the complex matter of body. Like you are finding one solution for 
           one issue but at the same time new problems are arising. You are diagnosing one disease but new advance disease with no treatment
           is emerging. So, the medical field is a huge unsolved mystery or puzzle in its own.

        <p>The human body is a complex, highly organized structure made up of unique cells that work together to accomplish the specific functions necessary for sustaining life, to tissues and organs. 
           The cells in a tissue are not identical, but they work together to accomplish specific functions.
           There is no doubt about it, the human body is complex, perhaps the most complex machine on earth. 
           This is why body donation is crucial to the practice of medicine.
           It is critical for surgeons to educate themselves and to be well practiced on all surgical procedures, both complicated and routine.</p>

            <p>The earth is the planet that we live on and it is the fifth-largest planet. 
               It is positioned in third place from the Sun. This essay on earth will help you learn all about it in detail. 
               Our earth is the only planet that can sustain humans and other living species. 
               The vital substances such as air, water, and land make it possible.The rocks make up the earth that has been around for billions of years. 
               Similarly, water also makes up the earth. In fact, water covers 70% of the surface. It includes the oceans that you see, the rivers, the sea and more.
               Thus, the remaining 30% is covered with land. The earth moves around the sun in an orbit and takes around 364 days plus 6 hours to complete one round around it. 
               Thus, we refer to it as a year.</p>

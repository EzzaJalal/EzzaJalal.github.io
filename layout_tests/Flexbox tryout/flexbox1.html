            <p>I am almost becoming overwhelmed by the responsibility of responding to the sky. The more I pay attention
                to it, the more there is to notice.
                There is almost not enough time to write it all down, particularly as it constantly shifts. In fact, the
                sky is never not active.
                The myth that the sky becomes black at night is easy enough to disprove. Only look up at night and you
                will find it full of incident, albeit of a subtler nature than that with which it is colored during the
                day.
                There are infinite shades of gray and darkness, clouds are visible, and the lights continue to change,
                depending on the celestial bodies.
                Stars create elaborate punctuations and phrasing, causing some to postulate on their arrangements. Then
                there is the moon.
                We were walking on the long, hard beach one afternoon, when suddenly we spied, just next to a mountain,
                the enormous, evanescent full moon appearing in the blue sky.
                Sitting on the beach at night, with the full moon by now high in the dark sky, its light reflected on
                the ocean waters, oneâ€™s whole being was taken over by something that does not have a name.
                I remember thinking that the most important thing for me, in order to write about the sky, was to have
                access to an open stretch of horizon line, where sky meets sea.
                A big, open sky is important, as one could have in the western United States. But the actual line of
                contact between elements is the trigger that enables these observations.
                Back in New York, I seldom even notice the sky and rarely feel it. When I do, it is as a bright color
                that is reassuring, as if to tell me there are other skies, and actual horizons, somewhere.</p>

            <p>Winters are the coolest season that starts from December and last till March. 
               The peak time when winter is experienced the most in December and January. In addition, the essence it has is admired by many people. 
               Winters give you the time to indulge in various activities like snowball fighting, building snowmen, ice hockey and more. 
               It is a great time for kids to enjoy their vacations and get cozy in their blankets. During winters, schools usually take a break and close down. 
               The days are shorter and the nights get longer. The chilly mornings give you a different sense altogether. Hot drinks like coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are enjoyed more during winters. 
               The sun rises quite late and sometimes it does not. Even when it does, it doesnâ€™t get a bit hot. People long for a little sunshine as the cold weather sends chills down the spine. 
               You see people on the roads burning woods and paper to get a little warmth. However, not many people prefer going out in winters. They like sitting by the fireplace or heater all day.
               In the hilly areas, people experience snow during winters. They have to shovel it out of the way to make way for walking. The essence of winters is enhanced by Christmas as well. 
               It sets the holiday mood for people and is admired all over the world. But, there is also a downside of this season. The farmers, homeless people, and animals are most affected by this season. 
               There is hardly any business in this season for farmers. Hundreds of homeless people die due to the harsh winters. As the animals do not have proper shelter, they too lose their lives. 
               In addition, many flights are also canceled during this season. Nonetheless, this does not make winter any less important. It is quite essential to maintain balance in the weather of our country.</p>

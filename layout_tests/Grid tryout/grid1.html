            <p>Summer season is the hottest season of the year. In this season the temperature became so high that water starts to evaporate very quickly. 
               But this is the most entertaining season for kids who enjoy it to the fullest because their school gets off in the summer season. 
               Usually, summers last for mid or later March to June but they can expend up to the first week of July due to a delay of monsoon.
               The season occurs when the earth tilts towards the sun and a vice versa phenomenon for winter. In the southern hemisphere, December to February are the summer months. 
               The day becomes warmers and nights become cooler. Besides, the day is longer and nights are shorter. This season, we get a lot of variety of fruits and vegetables. 
               And this is the season in which farmers prepare their land for cultivation. The sky becomes clearer as there are no clouds to give shade. And the sun shines bright.
               There are many good things about summer that includes the king of fruits and everyone’s favorite ‘Mango’. Apart from that, there is a large variety of fruits and vegetables in the market.
               To conclude, we can say that the summer season is not as bad as it looks. It is just like any other season. We can also enjoy summer like any other season by finding the right ways like kids. 
               Moreover, the season is rich in a variety of fruits and vegetables especially the mango.</p>
